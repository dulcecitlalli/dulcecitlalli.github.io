<p> My academic trajectory started whit my career in mechatronic engineering at TecNM campus Toluca, when I obtained experience with projects focused on robotics and control. However, when I studied for my master’s degree in Automatic Control at CINVESTAV, my thesis was about a laparoscopic simulator, I programmed the dynamic surface, and I integrated a robot to interact with the virtual world. During my PhD studies at CINVESTAV, I developed a Brain-computer interface, I developed my algorithms. I have been working as a Research Professor since 2016 at TecNM campus Nuevo Leon, and I have led students to develop their thesis in the field of Biomedical Engineering. I wrote scientific articles where I reported my algorithms in biomedical data. </p>
